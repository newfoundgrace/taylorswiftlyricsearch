- be responsive
- use at least one API, preferably more than one API/multiple endpoints from the same API
- polished appearance
- use an API that either supports cross-origin-resource-sharing (CORS) or offers response data in the JSONP format
- ensure that the API you choose uses the HTTPS protocol
- do not use a proxy server to get around CORS issues
